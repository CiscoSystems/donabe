title: About the Project

<p>
  Donabe is a simple virtual application infrastructure deployment service for OpenStack. It was developed alongside the <a href="http://ciscosystems.github.io/curvature/index.html">Curvature</a> Advanced Dashboard project with the aim of changing the way that users interact with cloud-based virtual environments.
</p>  
<p>
  It is based around the concept of designing re-usable virtual application components from a set of OpenStack virtual networking and compute components. These components or "containers" can then be used to design increasingly complex application topologies by nesting them recursively within each other.
</p>
<p>
  More details about the design and usage of Donabe can be found on the OpenStack Foundation website <a href="http://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/session-videos/presentation/interactive-visual-orchestration-with-curvature-and-donabe">here</a>.
